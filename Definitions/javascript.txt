What are you Javascript ?
    ** Javascript is a Single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous concurrent
       language.
    ** Javascript have the call stack, event loop, and callback queue and apis.

1) Single-threaded:-
        One thing at a time == One call Stack == One thread

2) Event Loop:-
       (The code is pushed into CALL STACK, if it is an asynchronous request
        it pop from the stack and pushed into the WEB APIS, after the process
        completion it pushed into CALLBACK QUEUE, now event loop come into the
        place, if stack is empty and it check the callback queue, if a process
        is running it immediately pushed into the stack that's what event Loop
        basically does)
        *  It will look at the callback queue and call stack.
        *  If call Stack is empty check the callback queue, if there is any
           process running push into the call stack or remain idle.

3) WebAssembly:- (WASM)
      WebAssembly (Wasm) enables compilation of code written in C++ and other languages to               run on the web.
